    we also have silo services - a farm silo building company 

    - we will be focusing on the features of a new system that will allow their customers 
    to come up with a rough plan for their silos with rough quote before they discuss 
    directly with stuff. (that will be a full day on the 16th of Nov)

    -Rough plan
    -Rough quote


My Solution:

    A website that will allow a user to put in parameters, veiw a preview of the silos
    and the approximate cost

What is a Silo? (Can also be called grain bins)

    (from: https://www.ukfrs.com/promos/17115)

    A silo is a structure for storing bulk materials. Silos are used in agriculture to store grain, powders, fermented feed (known as silage) and animal slurry.

    Silos are used by other industries for bulk storage of coal, cement, sand, woodchips, metal waste, food products and sawdust. Silos range in height from around 10m to 90m with a capacity of 20 to 80 tons.

    Different types of silos include:

        Sealed silos - used to protect the contents from damp and insects
        Silo bags - made from a waterproof and UV-protecting film
        Aerated silos - designed for fine powders; by pumping air into the silo it causes the powder to act as a fluid
